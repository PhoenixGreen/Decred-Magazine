@: Decred Magazine Proposal

* Domain: Marketing
* Amount: $34,000
* Start Date: 01 July 2022
* End Date: 30 June 2023

## What
This proposal seeks funding for a content hub called DecredMagazine.com. The aim is to syndicate Decred media from a single outlet.

## Why
At the current time there is a broad array of excellent content across platforms wide and varied. For many reasons, this content doesn’t aways reach the community or can at times feel fragmented. It’s for this purpose, I would like to propose a magazine styled content delivery system. Aims include:

* Content to be collected and distributed from a single outlet
* A Decred first focus – no intrusive advertisements or off-topic sidebars
* Content focused – with an easy to share, easy to promote and easy to re-distribute ethos
* Regular content – two to four pieces a week is the initial aim
* Reduced barrier of entry – for content creators and community members
* Semi-professional structure – Medium to long form content. Contributor's work will be proofed by editors before published.
* Easy to find and navigate
* Consistent user experience
* Automated social media campaigns
* A home for Decred content creators

A single place for medium and long form Decred content, would have the effect of consolidating community communication and marketing efforts. Desirable effects include:

* Onboarding new community members and crypto enthusiasts
* A consistent experience for people wanting to learn and dig deeper into Decred
* Regular content will reenforce the feeling of an active community

## How
Decredmagazine.com is a hub for participating Decred content and multimedia creators. The platform uses open sourced technology and content delivered will be distributed under the Creative Commons licence Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). 

Suitable backups will be maintained to aid in the longevity and future of the initiative. This will expand and harden as the project matures, including full source code becoming available to the community.

The following roles will maintain the platform, Editors, Official Contributors and Contributors. 
* Editors – Approve and publish all contributors work; investigate and publish work from other forums e.g. social media, general news articles etc… 
* Official Contributors – Are regular content providers paid as part of this proposal through CMS and paid in Decred
* Contributors – Are community members who submit content to the platform unpaid initial or paid through other means

Once the content has been published, each piece can have a marketing campaign assigned to it, if appropriate, which includes the following systemised schedule:

* Initial Subscriber Email Newsletter
* Initial publication sharing – Matrix, Reddit, Twitter
* Social media scheduling. Currently relayed on @DecredMagazine and @DecredSociety Twitter, Facebook accounts. Depending on the content, the social media schedule can be:
	* 2 weeks – 9 unique posts, over two weeks
	* 1 Month – 8 unique scheduled posts 
	* 2 Months – 15 unique scheduled posts
	* 1 Year – 24 unique scheduled posts
