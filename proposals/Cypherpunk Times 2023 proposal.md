## What
This proposal seeks funding to continue the work started last year with the DecredMagazine.com content hub. You’ll also be voting to rebrand DecredMagazine.com to CypherpunkTimes.com and move the project to a multi-chain publication.

## Why
The original and continued aims of Decred Magazine were to bring Decred’s media content together in one place and to build a consistent and regular flow of information. To both of these points, the proposal has fulfilled the initial goal of creating a landing pad for those seeking to remain informed or learn more about the project.

As to be expected, there is always room for improvement, but generally, I’ve been impressed with the hard work and efforts that have gone into this initiative by all those involved. Moving forward, there are two areas that, I believe, are important to focus on. The first being to continually find ways of improving the quality of the content being produced, and the second is to build a significantly larger audience. 

The main thoughts behind rebranding the magazine is to extend the reach of the publication and to be more inclusive of other projects that share similar goals. For instance, our social media engagement typically reaches between 100 and 2000 people. When we engage with other projects like Digibyte, this number increases tenfold, e.g. the first Digibyte article received over 27,000 social media views – https://twitter.com/decredmagazine/status/1637029887675453443

This initiative also opens the door for a multi-DAO funded publication. Where each project can fund its editor, writers and content creators. Furthermore, by opening up the publication to more communities, we can extend the talent pool of writers and content creators.

The final thought for this move is to insert Decred into the wider crypto narrative and breakout of our perceived communication bubble. Although the audience would be shared across a range of projects, the exposure for our tech would be exponential compared to the current reach, especially considering Decred's emerging narrative, “Decred is building infrastructure as a public good”. 

## How
CypherpunkTimes.com is a hub for participating crypto content and multimedia creators. The platform uses open sourced technology and the content delivered will be distributed under the Creative Commons licence Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). 

Suitable backups have and will continue to be maintained to aid in the longevity and future of this initiative — https://github.com/PhoenixGreen/Decred-Magazine-Backup

The focus of this publication will be to deliver a coherent message that supports projects building innovative tech based around the cypherpunk principles.
* Content to be collected and distributed from a single outlet
* No intrusive advertisements or off-topic sidebars
* Content that’s easy to share, promote and re-distribute
* Reduced barrier of entry for content creators and communities
* Semi-professional structure
* Easy to find and navigate with a consistent user experience
* A home for crypto content creators 

There are some obvious challenges with moving to a multi-chain publication. To avoid contention at a later date, I propose these initial publication rules:

**Publishing rules:**
To be included in the “Cypherpunk Times” publication, a project should have at least 5-years of active development. The project must be open source and producing permissionless tech.

To reduce the publication becoming heavily one-sided, I propose a maximum cap of five articles a week per project, with a possible reduction to three / four once more communities become active.

Publication aims should be set on several principles. Content that reaches outside these fundamentals should include appropriate advice or warnings. Principles include:
* Open source
* Non-custodial
* Permissionless
* No KYC policies 
* Peer to peer
* Encryption and privacy
* Decentralised

**Acceptable content:**
* Project achievements, milestones, technical achievements and news updates
* Innovation and emerging technologies
* News related articles
* Educational tutorials and product onboarding

**Unacceptable content:**
* No fluff pieces that make exaggerated claims or hyped expectations
* No shameless promotion, advertising, or linking to non-relevant sources

## Who
The following roles will maintain the platform, Editors and Contributors. 
* Editors – Proof read, Approve and publish contributors work; investigate, import and publish work from other forums e.g. social media, general news articles etc… 
* Decred Contributors – Are regular content providers paid as part of this proposal through CMS and paid in Decred (dcr)
* Other Contributors – Are content providers from other crypto projects. Paid or unpaid through the relevant DAO / project fund.

PhoenixGreen (aka. Decred Society) has been delivering Decred content for the past three years, with the purpose of education and understanding. He also contributes to the Decred Video Proposal.

As this project moves forward, the aim is to add more contributors and editors. Current contributors include – OfficialCryptos, BlockchainJew, João Santanna, Kozel, and Applesaucesome.

## Role
PhoenixGreen – Editor / Contributor. Will manage, coordinate, import and publish content from across the participating communities / crypto projects. As well as produce original and curated content.

OfficialCryptos – Contributor. Delivers featured images and medium form articles.

Applesaucesome – Contributor. Once the market picks up will resume delivering posts for Decred markets, broader market and technical analysis. 

João Santanna - Contributor. Will continue to create articles for the following series Coin comparisons, Crypto is South America, Crypto news, and cross-chain interviews. João will also be working with the Vanguard group to coordinate organic social media from the publication. Social media includes – Twitter, Instagram and TikTok.

BlockchainJew – Contributor. Writes articles on smart contract technology, crypto news and events, emerging technologies and implementations.

Kozel – Contributor. Will produce technical articles. Article ideas include, setting up and running a lightning network node / Liquidity provider, running a full node, setting up a voting service provider (VSP).

As this proposal progresses, the hope is to add additional Contributors and communities.

## When
The aim is to deliver regular content for one year. The expected content will be from a range of areas, including but not limited to:
* Individual project news and general crypto news
* Economic and current events that highlight crypto’s strengths
* Research, markets, data and broader technical analysis
* Project development and ecosystem articles
* Emerging technology

Once the content has been published, each piece can have a marketing campaign assigned to it, if appropriate, which includes the following systemised schedule:

* Initial Subscriber Email Newsletter
* Initial publication sharing – Matrix, Reddit, Twitter
* Podcast episode for video and audio content
* Social media scheduling. Currently relayed on @cypherpunkTimes and @DecredMagazine Twitter, Facebook accounts. Depending on the content, the social media schedule can be:
	* 2 weeks – 9 unique posts, over two weeks
	* 1 Month – 8 unique scheduled posts 
	* 2 Months – 15 unique scheduled posts
	* 1 Year – 24 unique scheduled posts

## Budget
The proposal for the previous Decred Magazine proposal had a monthly budget of $2800/month. The total amount billed during this time was $30,200 (final month is estimated)

The monthly budget for this proposal will be $3600 per month. This is a hard maximum, which includes room for new contributors. We do not expect to hit the max every month. All payouts will be in Decred and contractors will bill via the Contractor Management System (CMS).

This proposal will fund the maintenance of the publication, Decred related content, and other relevant content that enhances the Decred message. The eventual aim is to have other participating projects, fund and coordinate their content. There will, of course, be some crossovers whilst we get up and running.

* Articles published and newsletters sent – 460
* Social media campaigns created / published – 98
* Social media followers (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) – 1350
* Podcasts created – 73
