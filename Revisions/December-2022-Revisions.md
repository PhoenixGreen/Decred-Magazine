## Site Admin
Reporting Structure: Completion Date - Work undertaken - Link or detailed description
* Onboarded C12 as a new contributor for the degen crowd
* Onboarded Zippycorners (Matt Hawkins) as a technical editor for Decred Magazine. This is still a work in progress and a new tier for technical writters will probably have to be thought about for the next proposal. But it does give use the opportunity to create more detailed posts, which I think we are currently lacking.
