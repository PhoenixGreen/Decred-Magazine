## Site Admin
Reporting Structure: Completion Date - Work undertaken - Link or detailed dscription
* Sept 4th - Upgrade site and theme plus error and breakage checking - Decred Magazine now has built-in search and comments. These were both features I held off including due to third party tracking. These are built-in so no third party included. Which also makes the services extreamly light weight and fast.
* Sept 6th - Conducted a full backup of Decred Magazine up to August 31st 2022. This is stored on local development environment, on Backup drive, and on Google Drive.
* TO DO ---------- Upload full backup to GitHub with removed subscriber info and author email addresses to be compliant with privacy regulations.
