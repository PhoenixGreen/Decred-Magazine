* Wbsite backup - 5/5/2023 - Full back up completed
* Communications - Started thinking about and discussing the next Decred Magazine proposal for Mid-June 2023. One idea that is gaining traction, is to move to a multi-chain publication. Possibly funded by multiple DAO’s. This does raise some issues with logistics and problematic articles, but the massive upside is a bigger audience.
